Homework

To go over what we have done today, we are going to give out a start point for you to look through and understand then add/refactor the functionality in it.

We would like you to complete the following tasks using the start point:

Add JS code to allow a new cat to be added programmatically. Do it rough and ready at first!
Refactor the code to make it easy to add a new cat, just like we did with the quotes.
OPTIONAL: Remove the cat data in the HTML and add them via your javascript. If you want to be fancy, put the cat data into an array.
OPTIONAL: Style the site!
Hint: Be careful with the order you append your elements to each other! Also be careful with what you need to pass when setting an image's width via the DOM.
